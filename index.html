  <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
  <h2>These are a few of my favorite things</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photography</strong></li>
    <p>I have been a portrait photographer for (officially) two years now. I say officially because I have been taking photos much longer than that, but I only just got my LLC in 2020 and began turning my passion into a business.</p>

    <li><strong>Playing with my cats & dogs</strong></li>
    <p>My dog Snickers (left) is ten years old. She has been my best friend her whole life, and I always love taking her on car rides, or to the park. Watson (right) is three years old, and his favorite activity is falling asleep on me <em>right</em> when I need to get up and go do something.</p>

    <li><strong>Spending time with my partner</strong></li>
    <p>We like to go hiking, hang out with our dogs, and check out local eateries. We really enjoy trying new foods and drinks whenever we can. It's a bonus if we can take our pups out with us.</p>
